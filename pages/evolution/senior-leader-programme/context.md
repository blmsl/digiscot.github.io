## Context

There is an increasing recognition and focus on the role of leadership to help drive digital change within organisations.

The evaluation of the 2016 senior leader action learning sets demonstrated the huge value of giving space and focus to digital, and having a safe peer support environment in which to do this. The leaders who met in 2016 are continuing their journey with ongoing regular meetings this year. They have shared their stories throughout the process, see for example [Mary Allison from Breast Cancer Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0kGyhe4g3k) or read this blog by [Neil Clapperton, CEO at Grampion Housing](http://www.scvo.org.uk/blog/digital-licence-great-things/).

[The New Reality](http://thenewreality.info/) research report explored what it means to be a third sector digital leader with over 50 leaders and digital experts. It highlights themes and issues that were common across organisations, and suggests some of the key takeaways from these discussions. It has a focus on both leadership and culture.

Recently there has been a welcome focus on the role of trustees and the board in helping to drive this agenda. The [2016 NFP synergy/ACEVO trustee survey](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/survey-finding-skill-trustees-want-most-board-digital-janet-thorne) highlighted that boards now feel they need to develop digital skills more than anything else. [This guide](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/making-digital-work-12-questions-for-trustees-to-consider) suggests that there are 12 key questions trustees should be considering in relation to the digital evolution of their organisations.

The [Call to Action](http://www.scvo.org.uk/news-campaigns-and-policy/research/digital-call-to-action/) below is a framework for Scotland, supported by OSCR and ACOSVO, to help guide and push the digital change agenda. Five key themes are highlighted which all third sector leaders need to consider and begin to engage with, and these will provide the structure for the leadership development programme in 2017:
