## One Digital: Senior Leaders Programme 

>*"Leaders in the third sector do not need to be digital experts, but we do need to lead change which will enable our organisations to be fit-for-purpose in a digital world."*

   **Creating a Digitally Confident Third Sector in Scotland**

The words from our [Call to Action](http://www.scvo.org.uk/news-campaigns-and-policy/research/digital-call-to-action/), launched in 2016 still ring true today. Almost half of charities lack organisational digital skills and 55% of charities see a lack of digital knowledge at board level being a key barrier. 

We know from working with a range of third sector Senior Leaders, who helped us write our [Call to Action](http://www.scvo.org.uk/news-campaigns-and-policy/research/digital-call-to-action/), that organisational digital change is ‘about the people and not the kit’.

Our established Senior Leaders Programme takes an ‘Action Learning Set’ approach and offers you the opportunity to build your personal knowledge and confidence on digital from our experienced facilitators, industry experts and our Programme Alumni. The outcome of the Programme will be a digitally engaged and enabled group of Senior Leaders who will design their own approaches to ensure a lasting impact for their organisations and on the wider sector.

Our programme is aimed at ‘Senior Leaders’; those with the authority to bring about real, active change for their organisation through digital, including: Chief Officers, Department Heads, Board Members and Trustees. Don’t worry, you don’t have to be a digital expert to take part; it’s about maximising your leadership skills to adapt services and approaches to make the most of a digitally evolving world and bringing your workforce along with you.

Here’s what some of our previous participants of our Senior Leaders Programme had to say about their experience:

>*“Participation in the programme has made me ask some fundamental questions about "how we do things around here" and some of these questions might not have been asked if I'd not been on the programme.”*

>*"The presentations were useful to think about things in a different way, gain new insights and learn for others.”*

>*"Time with peers, learning from them and also generating ideas from the facilitator and speakers has allowed me to introduce new and proven concepts within my organisation - to the team and service delivery.”*

Participants will be required to commit time to the Programme to attend sessions and complete actions between sessions. Find out more about what to expect in the [One Digital: Senior Leaders Programme Prospectus 2018](digiscot.github.io/files/Senior_Leaders_Programme_2018_Prospectus.pdf)

The programme will open for applications on **Tuesday 26th September**.
