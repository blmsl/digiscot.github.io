## What's your organisation's rating?

**Wondering how digitally competent your organisation is and what you can do to improve?**

That’s where our **Digital Check-up** comes in to help!

We know that currently 50% of third sector organisations in Scotland are not making the most of using digital technologies.  Many feel overwhelmed, not knowing where to start. Others may have jumped right in but are finding it challenging.  

Our engaging and simple to use Digital Check-up lets you easily assess your organisation’s current digital maturity and benchmark this against the sector; helping you to identify your strengths and the key gaps your organisation is facing in the following areas:

<ul class="browser-default">
  <li>Leadership, culture and skills</li>
  <li>Tools and equipment</li>
  <li>Content, marketing and data</li>
  <li>Cyber resilience and online threats</li>
</ul>

Once you have your digital maturity ratings, we’ll be able to signpost you to third sector relevant tools, resources and free SCVO Digital products and events that can maximise your strengths and help address those digital gaps.

If you would like to use our **Digital Check-up** to find out your rating and make a positive change to how your organisation ‘does digital’, please email us at [onedigital@scvo.org.uk](mailto: onedigital@scvo.org.uk).
