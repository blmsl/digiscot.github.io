## Getting your organisation more Cyber Resilient

**Is your organisation talking about cyber resilience?  Do you know what it is and what it means for you?**

>*Being “cyber resilient” is both the prevention of cyber breaches and also making sure that if a breach occurs that you are able to respond without losing business continuity. A cyber breach isn’t necessarily a ‘hack’, but it is any incident in which data is lost or stolen, including; accidental loss or theft of hardware, social engineering or phishing. The types of data could include financial data, security data or personal data – such as your customer's contact details.’*

> Kyle Usher, Digital Change Manager, SCVO

With 40% of charities rating their skills in cyber security as ‘low’ or ‘very low’ we’re aware that third sector organisations often lack the knowledge to assess and discuss cyber threats properly.  Additionally, for many Scottish charities cyber resilience is not discussed at a senior level or featured on organisational risk registers.

We are working with Scottish charities to achieve the following aims:

1. To build commitment from third sector leaders to assess and improve their cyber resilience. 
2. To test the ability of third sector organisations to achieve [Cyber Essentials accreditation](https://www.cyberaware.gov.uk/cyberessentials/) through a small scale ‘grants’ programme of up to £1500 to help cover the application and IT support costs needed to achieve accreditation.

**The SCVO Cyber Essential Grants are now closed. You can still find out more about [Cyber Essentials and why you should have it](https://digital.scvo.org.uk/files/cyber.pdf).**

If you are interested in becoming more cyber resilient and want to discuss this with the One Digital team, please contact us at [onedigital@scvo.org.uk](mailto: onedigital@scvo.org.uk)
