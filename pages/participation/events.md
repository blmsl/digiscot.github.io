## Tackling digital & social exclusion - local workshops

Join us at a local workshop to explore together how we can provide effective support to those facing digital and social exclusion.

Are you involved in working to tackle social exclusion? Whether you are working to support people to address barriers to employment, aiming to reduce social isolation or addressing other issues related to poverty and inequality, we would love for you to join us at one of our local roadshows. Timed broadly to coincide with the roll-out of full-service Universal Credit across Scotland, we want to explore the role local organisations can play in closing the digital divide, tackling the 'poverty premium' and preparing for a digital-by-default welfare system.
